# ntnx-escape-game
Roleplay to discover Nutanix platform

# Preparation
- Book a HPOC with following characteristics : 
    - 3 nodes cluster (no more, no less)
    - AOS 7 <- May need manual update
    - PC2024.3 <- May need manual update
    - Self-Service enabled
    - Leap Enabled
    - Flow security enabled
- prepare your sendgrid token.
  - If you do not have one, create an account and get a token.
- Upload the runbook  `blueprint/EG-prerequisites.json` in the `lab` project
- Launch it
- Upload the blueprint `blueprint/EG-EscapeGame.json` in the `lab` project (WARNING : Ensure you have launched the runbook first or you'll have problems)
  - Update NUTANIX credential with password `nutanix/4u` (in the credential menu)
  - Select cluster and primary Network (click on the `GAME` white square first)
- Launch it

!! IMPORTANT !! Known Issues : 
 - The current deployment has a little problem. Please update manually the project `production` to remove then re-add the user `thebadguy`
 - Please confirm the cluster has only 3 nodes (I experienced an issue once, because of erasure-coding). If not, please remove 4th node.

# Player prerequisites
- Internet Access
- If you want to use VPN access, ensure your players have installed and tested it first

# Game launch
- Use Day 2 action of the BP to :
  - Launch invitation email to your players (you'll have to enter recipients list)
  - Launch "End of lab" email (1st recipients list will be used)

Self-Service Application description will provide the URL to play, as it will be mentioned in the invitation email too.

# TIPS
- Unsuccesfull lab checks may happen even if the exercise is succesfully done. In this case, the player can refresh is web page, use the same trigram, and recovery mode will bring him to the same lab step, which could pass...
  - This is caused by ID memorized by script during execution, but not existing anymore (for exemple, if the player has deleted and recreated OS image, the game will wait the old ID, not the new one.)
- If you need to setup a stage to a user, you can look at [gameContent.json](gameContent.json) file to identify the stage nomber you need to use.
